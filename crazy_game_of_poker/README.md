# Probability with Poker

### Combinatorics, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Simulation & Probability Distributions
 
- [poker.py](poker.py), a script with the rules of 5-card-stud poker, tests to make sure the ranking of hands is correct, and runs two simulations. 
    + Simulates 10-player, 5-card-stud poker games and determines the winner (or winners in the case of ties).
    + For fun, see how many games it takes to have a tie (limited to 10,000 games).
    
- [5_card_stud_tests.ipynb](5_card_stud_tests.ipynb) explores all possible combinations of 5-card hands from a 52-card deck (Combinatorics).  
    + Introduces Recursion and Dynamic Programming.
