# Probability with Poker

### Combinatorics, Permutations, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, Simulation & Probability Distributions
 
- [poker.py](poker.py), a script with the rules of 5-card-stud poker, tests to make sure the ranking of hands is correct, and runs two simulations. 
    + Simulates 10-player, 5-card-stud poker games and determines the winner (or winners in the case of ties).
    + For fun, see how many games it takes to have a tie (limited to 10,000 games).
    
- [5_card_stud_tests.ipynb](5_card_stud_tests.ipynb) explores all possible combinations of 5-card hands from a 52-card deck (Combinatorics and Permutations).  
    + Introduces Recursion and Dynamic Programming. 
    
- [poker_refactored.py](poker_refactored.py) as the name suggests refactors [poker.py](poker.py).

- [seven_card_stud.py](seven_card_stud.py). The first of three 7-card poker game scripts.  This was a homework assignment from a refersher cs212 course on udacity.  This one, as well as the python scripts above, were half inspired by the course. The ipython notebooks and scripts below are soley my own.

- [hold_em.py](hold_em.py). Texas Hold-em.  A very popular variation of poker where players recive two cards and build a best 5-card hand from their two hidden cards and five communal cards.

- [utils7card.py](utils7card.py).  Since hold-em and seven-card stud both create their best 5-card hand from 7 cards, utils7card is a modular approach for reusability. 

- [7card_poker_tests](7card_poker_tests).  Continuing probability with poker.   Probability Distributions of possible handranks and winning hands for the three poker games above.
